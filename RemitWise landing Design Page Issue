This is a sample of landing page UIUX issue raised..so i've designed two samples, i want you to check so i can proceed with the mobile versions
I worked on the heros section of remitwise  using simple and illustrative images.
I worked on the features section using cards with suble shadows and minimal icons
I worked on quick action sections using brand colous with a mix of simple illustrations which relays the primary value of Remitwise
